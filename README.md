## Built for Dubhacks 2020

## Inspiration

We were inspired by connecting musicians to their fans during this pandemic - bringing the scene out to everybody, everywhere.

## What it does

Allows fans to keep up with the latest artists' live streams, merch drops, etc.

## Running the Code
1. Clone the Git repository
2. Inside the created folder, run npm install
3. Run npm run build, followed by npm start
4. A browser page should open with the app running.

## How we built it

Built a front-end react app with a back-end in node.js, hosted on digitalocean.

## Challenges we ran into

We initially tried to use azure for hosting, spent several hours on it, and were forced to pivot to digitalocean.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Building a slick, beautiful app to connect musicians to their fans.

## What we learned

Hackathons require great discipline and determination to succeed. Going for 24 hours straight and doing work that normally takes 3 weeks of regular dev time is an eye-opening experience.

## Where will Amplifi go next

We plan to scale up and fully implement our API on a more powerful service such as Azure, where our platform can realize its full potential.
